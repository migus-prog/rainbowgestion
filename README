The AutoLoad class provides a PSR-0 (https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) compatible method to load required classes using namespaces for PHP 5.3+. For a class to the comply with the standard the following criteria must be met:

 - A fully-qualified namespace and class must have the following structure \<Vendor Name>\(<Namespace>\)*<Class Name>
 - Each namespace must have a top-level namespace ("Vendor Name").
 - Each namespace can have as many sub-namespaces as it wishes.
 - Each namespace separator is converted to a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR when loading from the file system.
 - Each "_" character in the CLASS NAME is converted to a DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR. The "_" character has no special meaning in the namespace.
 - The fully-qualified namespace and class is suffixed with ".php" when loading from the file system.
 - Alphabetic characters in vendor names, namespaces, and class names may be of any combination of lower case and upper case.

To use the autoloader first include the class:


 require 'Solfenix/AutoLoad/AutoLoad.php';


Once the class is available the autoloader needs to be registered, for example:


 spl_autoload_register( 'Solfenix\AutoLoad\AutoLoad::run' );


The base path where your classes are located can be set if needed, for example:


 AutoLoad::setPath( array( 'path', 'to', 'files' ) );


This would resolve to path/to/files/<Vendor Name>/(<Namespace>/)*<Class Name>, however, the namespace would remain the same:


 use <Vendor Name>\(<Namespace>\)*<Class Name>;


The extension used for your classes can also be set, for example:


 AutoLoad::setExtension( 'class.php' );


This would search for files ending in **.class.php**, for example:


 path/to/files/Solfenix/AutoLoad/AutoLoad.class.php
